pre tag in html copies the data as it is.
difference between GET and POST -> GET takes all the inputs in the URL , POST dont show it in URL it just takes the data
csrf is used for security where input is given
Removed admin from Shop urls, because we are not using admins in shop page.
include is used to include other app urls of in the main project 
Templates folder in apps is useful to use templates (this folder will have another directory name same as the app)
same with static folder in every app (Static folder will contain all the files and images)
Also add the apps created in the settings folder
